# MemeXpress
Welcome to MemeXpress! ðŸŽ‰ This is a fun and interactive React app that I've developed while diving into various fundamental concepts of React. Through this project, I've gained hands-on experience with event handling, state management, conditional rendering, form handling, API calls from "https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes" and handling side-effects in a React application.

# Getting Started:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory using cd meme-generator.
- Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
- Start the development server with npm start. This will launch the app in your default web browser.
